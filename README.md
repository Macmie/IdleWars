# IdleWars
Just a small, mostly portfolio-related project. Later, some more info about used technologies and algorithms will be described in ReadMe


# Main Idea
The game is thought to be small, almost pocket-size. The goal it to create a idle war simulator. 

Levels will include 2+ Spawner buildings. At least 1 for player and enemy. More buildings will be added and will be unlockable in further levels.

The goal of each level is to destroy enemy base.

# Game Loop

There will be two main currencies:
- gold
- souls

Gold will be used to upgrade buildings and tick while souls will be used to upgrade soldiers AND gold amount gained.
Gold will be given to player each tick.

Tick will be time-based event. It will grant player with gold. 
Souls will be obtained on units killed - both player and enemy (probably)

# Summary

As you can see the game is small, mostly for practice and portfolio. If it becomes any bigger and anybody will play it? I do not know at this point :D
